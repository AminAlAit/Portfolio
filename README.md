There are many examples of natural facts that can be described in mathematical terms. Nice examples are the shape of snowflakes, the fractal geometry of romanesco broccoli or how self-similarity rules the growth of plants.

In this notebook, I will be using the ggplot2 package. This package is home to many important features that will be useful not only to do art but also to represent data in real-life problems.
