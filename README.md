When beginning a career in data science, one often wonders what programming tools and languages are being used in the industry, and what skills one should learn first. By exploring the 2017 Kaggle Data Science Survey results, you can learn about the tools used by 10,000+ people in the professional data science community.

This project uses a subset of the 2017 Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey dataset.

In this notebook, I will be using the following packages: 
1. tidyverse
2. dplyr
3. tidyr
4. ggplot2

There are many examples of natural facts that can be described in mathematical terms. Nice examples are the shape of snowflakes, the fractal geometry of romanesco broccoli or how self-similarity rules the growth of plants.

In this notebook, I will be using the ggplot2 package. This package is home to many important features that will be useful not only to do art but also to represent data in real-life problems.
